          So the first thing I wanted to try was a simple "blog" style layout in
          html & css. You would be very famillier with this layout if you read
          any articals online, its seen so often that I would even go as far as
          to call it generic, however that is not a bad thing. The layout is
          easy to understand and generally allows for the content to flow
          naturally for the user. This content is static.

        <h2>Whoa boiler plate text right ?</h2>
        <p class="text-body">
          The text below was to mess with <u>underlined</u>
          <em>italicised</em> and <strong>emboldened</strong> text.
          <br />
          Whoa I really love boiler plate text to use in shitty projects when
          the
          <u>client</u> has no damn text because y'know, developers are
          <em>copy righters</em>, and
          <strong>"I thought you were making the website not me"</strong>..
          <br />
          fuck off clients.
